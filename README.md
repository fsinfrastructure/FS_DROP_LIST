## Drop Lists

### Spamhaus Donâ€™t Route or Peer List (DROP)
The DROP list will not include any IP address space under the control of any legitimate network - even if being used by persistent and well-known spammers. DROP will only include net-blocks allocated directly by an established Regional Internet Registry (RIR) or National Internet Registry (NIR) such as ARIN, RIPE, AFRINIC, APNIC, LACNIC or KRNIC or direct RIR allocations.
